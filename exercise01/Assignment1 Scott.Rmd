## Probability Practice

#### Part A
The fraction of people who answered yes given that they are truthful clickers is 71.43%.

#### Part B
The probability of that someone has the disease given that they test positive is very low, only 2.42%! If they were to implement a universal testing policy for this disease, most people who test positive will not have the disease ~ about 97.58% actually. This would cause chaos, and proves that a universal testing policy for this disease is not recommended.   

## Exploratory Analysis: Green Buildings
First we need to clean up the data a little bit and make sure the categorical variables are changed to factors in R.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
green_data = read.csv('greenbuildings.csv')

green_data$renovated = as.factor(green_data$renovated)
green_data$class_a = as.factor(green_data$class_a)
green_data$class_b = as.factor(green_data$class_b)
green_data$green_rating = as.factor(green_data$green_rating)
green_data$LEED = as.factor(green_data$LEED)
green_data$Energystar = as.factor(green_data$Energystar)
green_data$net = as.factor(green_data$net)
green_data$amenities = as.factor(green_data$amenities)
```

We decided to plot LEED vs. RENT and ENERGYSTAR vs. RENT to see if there was a difference between being LEED or ENERGYSTAR certified vs. not being certified. The results are belw.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Compare RENT values vs. being LEED or ENERGYSTAR CERTIFIED 
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(green_data$LEED, green_data$Rent, xlab='LEED CERTIFED', ylab='RENT', col='pink')
plot(green_data$Energystar, green_data$Rent, xlab='ENERGYSTAR CERTIFED', ylab='RENT', col='burlywood')
```

As you can see from the plots above, being LEED certified does not increase the amount you can charge your tenant for rent. The average is actually slightly lower than the average of those buildings who are not LEED certified. In contrast, being ENERGYSTAR certified is advantageous becuase you can charge tenants more for rent than if you were a building that was not ENERGYSTAR certified. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#compare LEEDS vs. ENERGY STAR in Gas costs
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(green_data$LEED, green_data$Gas_Costs, xlab='LEED CERTIFED', ylab='GAS COSTS', col='pink')
plot(green_data$Energystar, green_data$Gas_Costs, xlab='ENERGYSTAR CERTIFED', ylab='GAS COSTS', col='burlywood')
```

From the plots above you can see that if you are ENERGYSTAR certified gas costs are the same as weather you are not and they are low. If you are LEEDS certified though, gas costs are actually higher, thus ENERGYSTAR certified gas costs are lower than LEED certified gas costs.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#compare LEEDS vs. ENERGY STAR in ELECTRICITY COSTS
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(green_data$LEED, green_data$Electricity_Costs, xlab='LEED CERTIFED', ylab='ELECTRIC COSTS', col='pink')
plot(green_data$Energystar, green_data$Electricity_Costs, xlab='ENERGYSTAR CERTIFED', ylab='ELECTRIC COSTS', col='burlywood')
```

Electricity costs are definitely higher in the geographic regions for which ENERGYSTAR certified buildings are locared. They are higher than buildings with no certification and also higher than buildings who are LEED certified. LEED certified buildings have lower electricity costs than buildings who are not LEED certified.


```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(lattice)
bwplot(green_data$Rent~green_data$LEED|green_data$class_a, ylab='RENT',  xlab='LEED vs. NOT LEED', main='Rent by Class A and LEED')
```
```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(lattice)
bwplot(green_data$Rent~green_data$Energystar|green_data$class_a, ylab='RENT',  xlab='ENERGYSTAR vs. NOT ENERGYSTAR', main='Rent by Class A and ENERGYSTAR')
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(lattice)
bwplot(green_data$Rent~green_data$LEED|green_data$class_b, ylab='RENT',  xlab='LEED vs. NOT LEED', main='Rent by Class B and LEED')

```
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(lattice)
bwplot(green_data$Rent~green_data$Energystar|green_data$class_b, ylab='RENT',  xlab='ENERGYSTAR vs. NOT ENERGYSTAR', main='Rent by Class B and ENERGYSTAR')

```
Whether you are a class a building or class b building and Leed certified vs. Energystar certified has really no effect on Rent prices. There is not much variability in the average amount of rent for these categories.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Energy star has less cooling degree days, which means they use less energy
#which means utilites are cheaper and same for heating degree days
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(green_data$Energystar, green_data$cd_total_07, xlab='ENERGYSTAR', ylab='COOLING DEGREE DAYS', col='blue')
plot(green_data$LEED, green_data$cd_total_07, xlab='LEED', ylab='COOLING DEGREE DAYS', col='blue')

```
From the plots above you can see that those buildings who are ENERGYSTAR certified have less cooling days than LEED certified buildings, therefore using less energy, and having lower demand. Energystar certified buildings also have less cooling days than buildings that are not energystar certified or not leed certified. 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
#LEED CERTIFIED BUILDINGS cost more on cooling and heating days
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(green_data$Energystar, green_data$hd_total07, xlab='ENERGYSTAR', ylab='HEATING DEGREE DAYS', col='red')
plot(green_data$LEED, green_data$hd_total07, xlab='LEED', ylab='HEATING DEGREE DAYS', col='red')

```
The same trend can be found when looking at heating days on LEED vs. ENERGYSTAR certified buildings. ENERGYSTAR buildings hace a lot less heating days on average than LEED buildings. Energystar certified buildings also have less heating days than buildings that are not energystar certified or not leed certified. 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
#CLASS A OR CLASS B classification for energystar and for leed
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(green_data$LEED, green_data$class_a, xlab='LEED', ylab='CLASS A')
plot(green_data$LEED, green_data$class_b,  xlab='LEED', ylab='CLASS B')

```
```{r, echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(green_data$Energystar, green_data$class_a, xlab='ENERGYSTAR', ylab='CLASS A')
plot(green_data$Energystar, green_data$class_b,  xlab='ENERGYSTAR', ylab='CLASS B')
```
